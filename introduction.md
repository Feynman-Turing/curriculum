# Introduction

Traditional academic degree programs are 
4 Year long at Undergraduate or Bachelors level
1/2 Year long at Graduate or Masters level
3/5 Years long at Doctoral level

Subjects are divided in courses or modules and may be divided in parts:
Physics-I and Physics-II
Computer Architecture and Advanced Computer Architecture

Courses or Modules delivered Holistically Serially i.e. students must complete Physics-I and Physics-II to enroll in Circuits-I, where Circuits-I must be completed to enroll in Computer Architecture.

Though in reality, a snapshot of concepts within Physics-I and Circuits-I are required to understand Computer Architecture.

The methodology we have devised in to disaggregate the traditional courses or modules into Concepts. Concept is a Unit of delivery.

## Concepts

A Concept is a unit of learning and assessment.

*Graph Algorithms* is a Concept which require knowledge and understanding of a couple of basic mathematical concepts, graph theory, programming language constructs, and implementation in code.
