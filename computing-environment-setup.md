# Computing Environment

## Resource requirements

- Computer with 12G+ RAM and 128G+ storage available for reservation
- Computer with a 1G+ NIC - preferably wired
- Availability of a Gigabit 6+ port Eth switch (required at later stages)
- Linux as the primary bare-metal OS
- x86 Intel/AMD Arch processor
- Preferably a low-power workstation/desktop that you may leave on for extended periods
- Debian (Ubuntu is ok) as host OS
- VS Code (preferred) or VI(m) as IDE
- VI(m) as the editor
- Software requirements: Build Tools (gcc, python, etc), KVM, QEMU, Libvirt

Note that **Hardware - Digital Electronics & Computer Architecture** require a bunch of Electronics Analog and Digital components, Embedded Computers (i.e. RPi), and Test & Measurement devices (i.e. Digilent Analog Discovery); essentially a Home Student Lab setup.
