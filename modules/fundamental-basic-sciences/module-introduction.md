# Introduction to Module

$$
I = \int_0^{2\pi} \sin(x)\,dx
$$

The Fundamental Basic Sciences specialization covers the following **modules**:

- Mathematical Thinking
- Basic Mathematics
- Applied Mathematics
- Logic and Philosophy
- Applied Physics

This module mandates use of a Scientific Programming Language so the students get exposed to the tool(s) at an earlier stage, this can be done in many ways:

- Using a programming language such as Python (matplotlib, scilab, numpy, pandas, etc) - Recommended!
- [GNU Octave](https://octave.org/) - Recommended!
- [Matlab](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) - Highly Recommended!
- [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)
